## Project Design

HD was designed and built in two weeks.

I wrote the [proposal][proposal] and [database schema][schema] so that I could streamline the building process allowing me to focus on the coding having the structure already though out.



## Technology

HD is a single-page app using [Rails backend][backend] and [React front end][frontend]. I utilized [cloudinary][cloudinary] for the storage for images found in the website.


## The Future

HD was written with future development in mind this will allow me to expand the features and functionality as needed.
