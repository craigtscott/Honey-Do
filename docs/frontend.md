# Frontend

This project challenged us to apply the React.js framework to build a single page application.

## npm

Node package manager (npm) is used to install all of the frontend dependencies.


## Webpack

I employed webpack to handle the bundling of the frontend components.

## React & Redux

You can find all React components, Redux actions, API utilities, reducers, and store in the [frontend](../frontend) directory.

## jQuery

AJAX requests are built with jQuery allowing easy access to the Rails server.

## Sass & Flex

HD was styled with Sass with application of flex.

## Others

Other frontend dependencies are:

- React DOM
- React Router
- React History to manipulating the browser history
- Babel for transpiling JSX into JavaScript.
